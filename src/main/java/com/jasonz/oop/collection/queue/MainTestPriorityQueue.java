 * @description :
 * A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the priority.
 * It is known that a Queue follows the First-In-First-Out algorithm,
 * but sometimes the elements of the queue are needed to be processed according to the priority,
 * thatâ€™s when the PriorityQueue comes into play.
 * The PriorityQueue is based on the priority heap.
 * The elements of the priority queue are ordered according to the natural ordering,
 * or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time, depending on which constructor is used.
