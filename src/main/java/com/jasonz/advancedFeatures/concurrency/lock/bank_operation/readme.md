- Certainly! Hereâ€™s an example of how you might use Java concurrency features to handle bank transactions. 
- This example will use `ReentrantLock` to ensure thread safety when performing deposit and withdrawal operations.

### BankAccount Class with ReentrantLock

```java
import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

class BankAccount {
    private double balance;
    private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

    public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
        this.balance = initialBalance;
    }

    public void deposit(double amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " deposited " + amount + ", balance: " + balance);
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public void withdraw(double amount) {
        lock.lock();
        try {
            if (balance >= amount) {
                balance -= amount;
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " withdrew " + amount + ", balance: " + balance);
            } else {
                System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " insufficient funds for withdrawal, balance: " + balance);
            }
        } finally {
            lock.unlock();
        }
    }

    public double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
}
```

### Main Class to Simulate Transactions

```java
public class BankTransactionSimulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000.0);

        Runnable depositTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                account.deposit(100);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(100); // Simulate time taken for transaction
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        };

        Runnable withdrawTask = () -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                account.withdraw(50);
                try {
                    Thread.sleep(150); // Simulate time taken for transaction
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        };

        Thread thread1 = new Thread(depositTask, "Thread-1");
        Thread thread2 = new Thread(withdrawTask, "Thread-2");

        thread1.start();
        thread2.start();

        try {
            thread1.join();
            thread2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("Final balance: " + account.getBalance());
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **BankAccount Class**:
    - **balance**: Holds the account balance.
    - **lock**: A `ReentrantLock` to ensure that only one thread can modify the balance at a time.
    - **deposit**: Adds money to the account balance.
    - **withdraw**: Deducts money from the account balance if sufficient funds are available.

2. **Main Class**:
    - **depositTask**: A task for depositing money.
    - **withdrawTask**: A task for withdrawing money.
    - Two threads are created and started to simulate concurrent transactions.
    - `join()` is used to wait for both threads to complete before printing the final balance.

This example demonstrates thread-safe operations on a bank account using Java concurrency features.
